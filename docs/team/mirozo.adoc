== PROJECT: Scheduler

---

== Overview

Scheduler is a desktop application which is used to automate the process of scheduling interviews.
Its main feature is matching interviewees with interview time slots to generate an interview timetable.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added features to view the schedules in a list of tables, list of interviewees and interviewers using javafx and the necessary
css file to enhance the GUI of the Scheduler.
** What it does: Allows the user to view the schedules, as well as the information of interviewees and interviewers clearly.
** Justification: This features forms the core of the GUI, allowing user to view the and also to access the frontend of the application.
** Highlights: This enhancement required a deeper understanding of implementing javafx, such as having to form columns dynamically in creating a schedule
table. It is also challenging to involve integrating the multiple tables into one panel. Involves many research on what data structure can fit into the panel
and in the end decided on converting the table into a list cell view.

** Credits:

* *Minor enhancement*: Created a display command feature which allows the user to switch display using CLI command.
