== PROJECT: Scheduler



== Overview

People who hold leadership positions, especially those in student-led clubs, have to usually schedule interviews with those interested in applying to
leadership positions. Usually, there are clashing preferred time slots between interviewees, which the interviewer has to resolve.
We found that the current practice of constant back-and-forth messaging between interviewees and interviewers to resolve this to
be inefficient. We therefore came up with Scheduler, a desktop application used to automate the process of interview scheduling.

Its main feature is matching interviewees with interview time slots to generate an optimal interview timetable, and works with
two types of data: data on interviewees and interviewers.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the *ability to manually `add`, `edit` and `delete` entities (interviewees and interviewers)* in Scheduler.
** What it does: This allows the user to manually alter the data currently in Scheduler .
** Justification: This feature is necessary to the product as interview schedules change frequently - interviewees may suddenly
be unable to attend an interview, withdraw from the interview. Interviewers may also be forced to
withdraw due to urgent business. There may also be more applicants, and hence interviewees. In these cases, the ability to
manually change data in Scheduler is essential.
** Highlights: This enhancement deeply affects the foundational structure of Scheduler. It required an in-depth understanding of
the existing code base. The implementation was also challenging as it required changes to existing commands and needed to be
designed such that enhancements could be easily added. The large number of possible input arguments for these commands also required extensive testing
to ensure Scheduler was bug-free.
** Credits: Joshua Bloch, author of Effective Java, for his ideas on Builder patterns as a way to generate objects with optional parameters.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the ability to `clear` all entities from Scheduler's internal model.
