== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

==== Schedule View
The display schedule feature extends Scheduler to display multiple tables of schedule per day. It is a component in the `MainWindow` class
stored in a `ScheduleViewPanel` class. Within the `ScheduleViewPanel` class, objects of `ScheduleView` class are stored into the panel.

ScheduleViewPanel implements the following function:
*`fillPanel()` -- Fill the ScheduleView component with the schedule tables for each day.

Given below is an example scenario of what will be displayed to the user.

*Step 1. The user launches the application. The Ui will start and the MainWindow will be displayed first.
*Step 2. MainWindow will call all the children such as the HelpWindow, CommandBox, Result Display, StatusBarFooter, ScheduleViewPanel, IntervieweeListPanel
and InterviewerListPanel.
*Step 3. Once ScheduleViewPanel is called, it will take in a list of titles and ObservableList data from the Logic class. The list of titles
consist of the title column for each schedule table and the ObservableList data consists of the time slots allocated to each interviewee.
*Step 4. ScheduleViewPanel will call the ScheduleView class to fill each table and populate each table with the data given by the Logic class.
*Step 5. ScheduleView will have a .fxml file of a table and it will first be filled with the column titles, followed by the time slots and the
interviewee allocated to each time slots. The slot that has no interviewee will be displayed as "0".
*Step 6. ScheduleViewPanel will call and instantiate the ScheduleView object into a list card.
*Step 7. Once all the ScheduleView objects are instantiated into the respective list cards, the ScheduleView Panel will form a list of tables
containing the schedules of the day.
*Step 8. The MainWindow class will fill the Ui with the ScheduleViewPanel.

image::ScheduleViewSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Interviewee/Interviewer List View

Interviewee list view is generated by the class IntervieweeListPanel to display information of the interviewees. It is a component in the "MainWindow"
class. IntervieweeListPanel uses a TableView class to display the information of interviewees in a table format. It contains a static method to populate
the table with data:

* `initialise()` -- To first set the columns, and afterwards fill the columns with the data provided.

Interviewee list will provide the following information:
*1. Name
*2. NUS/Personal emails
*3. Faculty
*4. Academic Year
*5. Department Choice
*6. Available Time Slots
*7. Allocated Time Slot
*8. Tags

Interviewer list view has the similar steps of displaying information of the interviewers. The difference is in the details of the interviewers.

The interviewer list will provide the following information:
*1. Name
*2. Department
*3. Available Time Slots

Given below is a scenario of how the IntervieweeListPanel/InterviewerListPanel is filled.

*Step 1. The user launches the application. The Ui will start and the MainWindow will be displayed first.
*Step 2. MainWindow will call all the children such as the HelpWindow, CommandBox, Result Display, StatusBarFooter, ScheduleViewPanel, IntervieweeListPanel
and InterviewerListPanel.
*Step 3. Once IntervieweeListPanel is called, it will take in an ObservableList data from the Logic class. It contains all the information of the list
of interviewees
*Step 4. The class will initialise, setting the necessary columns.
*Step 5. Using the method `setItems()` from the tableView, data will be populated to their respective columns and form the interviewee list.


==== Interviewer List View

==== UI Refresh During Data Import

*Step 1. Once User imports a new .csv file, it will call the RefreshListener Interface.
*Step 2. UiManager will receive this method through the RefreshListener, thus calling dataUpdated to MainWindow class.
*Step 3. The RefreshListenerManager will call the MainWindow to refresh the ScheduleViewPanel.
*Step 4. ScheduleViewPanel will firstly clear all the data and input the updated data from the .csv file.
*Step 5. ScheduleViewPanel object will then be returned to the MainWindow and display the updated data.

image::ImportUIRefreshSequenceDiagram.png[]

// tag::logic[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram1_2.png[]

Users should be able to manually key in input (i.e add interviewers and interviewees). We therefore changed the Logic
package accordingly to suit our needs.

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

// end::logic[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores a list of `Schedule`. Each `Schedule` represents a schedule timetable.
* exposes a list of `ObservableList<ObservableList<String>>` that can be 'observed' by the UI. Each of the
  `ObservableList<ObservableList<String>>` represents the data of a `Schedule` object.
  The `ObservableList<ObservableList<String>>` objects are bound to the UI so that the UI automatically updates  when the data of the `Schedule` objects changes.
* exposes a list of `ObservableList<Interviewee>` that can be 'observed' by the UI.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

==== Schedule
The `Schedule` objects are filled up and created by the imported interviewer's availability. The inner data of a `Schedule` object is the same as the corresponding availability
table in the imported interviewer's availability. The data of the `Schedule` can be changed after running the scheduling algorithm.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::add[]

=== Add Interviewee/Interviewer feature
The add command is facilitated by the `AddCommandParser` class. It extends `AddCommandParser` by allowing it to parse
prefixes specific to our Scheduler app, namely:

* r/ROLE
* f/FACULTY
* ep/PERSONAL_EMAIL and ew/NUS_WORK_EMAIL
* y/YEAR_OF_STUDY
* d/DEPARTMENT
* s/SLOT

This command also requires access to the Model package, where the AddressBook implementation lives, as well as the
Storage package, where the `JsonSerializableAddressBook` implementation lives. Consequently, the following json-friendly
classes were added:

* JsonAdaptedInterviewee, JsonAdaptedInterviewer, JsonAdaptedDepartment, JsonAdaptedSlot

The following *sequence diagram* describes how the add command works when adding an interviewee:

image::AddSequenceDiagram_1_2.png[]

The following activity diagram shows the steps needed to add a new interviewee:

image::AddActivityDiagram_1_2.png[]

// end::add[]

=== Scheduling Feature
==== Algorithm
The scheduling of interviews is essentially a https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-bipartite-matching/[maximum bipartite matching problem].
The scheduling feature is trying to find the **maximum number of matching** between available interview slots
and interviewees.

In this application, the selected algorithm is https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hopcroft-karp-algorithm-for-maximum-matching-set-1-introduction/[Hopcroft-Kap algorithm].
The complexity of the algorithm is o(√v x e), which is reasonably fast. The relevant details of the algorithm are as below:

**Vertex** +
Interviewee and interview slot.

**Edge** +
An edge represents a possible matching relationship  between interviewee and interview slot. An edge exists between interviewee and interview slot if and only if the interviewee can attend the slot.

**Matching Criteria** +
An interviewee can match an interview slot(i.e. can attend it) if **all** the criteria below are fulfilled:

. The timing of the slot matches one of the available timings of the interviewee.
. The department of the interviewer at that interview slot matches the department of choice of the interviewee.

**Explanation of the Algorithm** +
The **activity diagram** below summarises the key steps in the algorithm.

image::HopcroftKarp.png[]

Referring to the diagram above, a graph between interviewees and interview slots will first be built. Specifically, the graph built is a bipartite
graph where each interviewee is linked to the slot that it can match and vice versa, but interviewees are not linked with each
other, same goes to interview slots. Thus, the 2 distinct groups of vertices in the graph are interviewee vertices and interview slot
vertices. Before continuing, please read the below clarification about the terms **unmatched** and **free**.

[IMPORTANT]
The term **unmatched** refers to a vertex that is not matched to its previous adjacent vertex by DFS. The term **free** refers to
a vertex that is not matched to any other vertex yet by DFS.

A breadth-first-search(BFS) is then conducted on all **free** vertices in the graph to search for <<Notes,augmenting paths>> which in the process will construct a layered graph.
The BFS is slightly special as it will visit adjacent vertex in an **<<Notes, alternating sequence of unmatched and matched edges>>**.

****
Starting from one of the free vertices in the graph, visit adjacent vertices(group x) that are **not matched to it (i.e. unmatched)** in a
breath-first manner. This is then followed by visiting adjacent vertices that are **matched to** the vertices in group x
in a breath-first manner.
****

The routine above is repeated until a layer of **free** vertices are found (i.e. augmenting path(s) is found) or the layered graph cannot be further extended
(i.e. all augmenting path have been exhausted).

If augmenting path(s) exists, depth-first-search(DFS) will then be applied to every **free** vertex in the last layer of the layered graph
to increase the number of matching between interviewee and interview slot. The DFS will start on one of the free vertices in the last layer and traverse through one of the
augmenting path(s) which the free vertex lies in. When DFS hits the ends of an augmenting path, the unmatched and matched relationships between the vertices along the path will be **flipped**.
Due to this alternating unmatched and matched relationship, the number of matching(a.k.a. cardinality) along the path will be increased by exactly 1 when the relationships along the path are flipped.

When the relationships are flipped, the vertices will be marked as used such that it cannot be used as one of the vertex
along the other augmenting paths in the layered graph for the other iterations of DFS on the current layered graph.

The process of BFS followed by DFS will keep repeating until no more augmenting path(s) can be found in the bipartite graph of interviewee and interview slots, which
marks the termination of the algorithm. At this point, the maximum number of matching have been found. This is based on a simple graph theory:

> The number of matching in a graph is maximal if and only if no more augmenting path exist.

The theory above is so because if an augmenting path exists, it means that the number of matching along that path can be increased
by 1, which in turn increases the number of matching in the graph.

===== Notes

. **Augmenting path**: A simple path alternating between unmatched edges and matched edges. An augmenting path must
start with a *free* vertex and ends with a **free** vertex. Thus, the patten of the alternating edges will always be
unmatched, matched, unmatched ...., matched, unmatched.

. **Matched edge**: An edge is matched if the two vertices connected by it are matched to each other in previous iterations of
the DFS. In the case of the application, one of the two vertices will be an interviewee and the other will be an interview slot.

. **Unmatched edge**: An edge is unmatched if the two vertices connected by it are not matched to each other in previous
iterations of DFS.

. **Layered graph**: A layered graph is a graph formed by multiple layers of vertices. In this case, the layers are alternating between
unmatched and matched vertices, except that the first layer of the graph are always a layer of free vertices. The last layer of the
of the graph can either be a layer of matched vertices or free vertices (if augmenting path(s) exists). Below is an example of a layered graph:

==== Implementation

The proposed implementation of this algorithm is to encapsulate the logic of the algorithm into a `Command` class under
`Logic` component, possibly with the help of some auxiliary classes. The command is then invoked when the user key in the relevant

The proposed implementation of this algorithm is to encapsulate the logic of the algorithm into a `Command` class under
`Logic` component, possibly with the help of some auxiliary classes. The command is then invoked when the user key in the relevant
command keyword (refer user guide).

When the scheduling algorithm has finished running, it will update the data in the `Schedule` objects to reflect the
allocated time slots to the interviewees, which the changes will then be reflected automatically in the UI.


=== Import
==== Implementation

The import feature uses `CsvReader` in the Model to read the given .csv file and stores the data into the model.

* `import interviewer <csv file>` stores the read data as a list of `Schedule` objects in the model.
* `import interviewee <csv file>` stores the read data as a list of `Interviewee` objects in the model.
* `CsvReader` makes use of `BufferedReader` to read data from the given file.

image::ImportSequenceDiagram.png[]
Given above is an example of a sequence diagram for importing interviewer's schedules. It applies to both importing interviewee's and interviewer's data.

As seen in the above sequence diagram, the execution of the import feature consists of these steps:

* Step 1: `LogicManager` will start executing the command by parsing it over to `AddressBookParser`.
* Step 2: `AddressBookParser` will then look and initialise an `ImportCommand` instance and return it to `LogicManager`.
* Step 3: `LogicManager` will then call execute() on the returned `ImportCommand`  object.
* Step 4: During the execute() method, the method will initialise a `CsvReader` object to `readInterviewers()` from the the given .csv file.
* Step 5: Each `Interviewer` object returned from Step 4 will then be added into model's `interviewerList`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::ImportActivityDiagram.png[]


=== Export
==== Implementation [Proposed]
The Export command gets the scheduled time slots from the Model and writes them in the specified .csv file.
CsvWriter facilitates the writing to the specified file.

* CsvWriter makes use of `BufferedWriter` to write data into the specified file.

Below shows the sequence diagram of an example export command.

image::ExportSequenceDiagram.png[]

The implementation is very similar to the Import feature. The only differences are in the Model where CsvWriter gets
the scheduled time slots from the Model and proceeds to write it into the specified file using a `BufferedWriter`.

The Activity Diagram below summarises the execution of the export command.

image::ExportActivityDiagram.png[]

// tag::email[]
=== [Coming soon in v1.4] Email
==== Implementation

The Email feature makes use of the `java.awt.Desktop` package to activate the default Mail client of the user.

* The `To:` field is automatically populated with all the emails that are tagged to a particular Interviewee.
* The `Cc:` field is configurable by the user via an optional configuration file.
* The subject and message body are also automatically populated with details that are relevant to the Interviewee, depending on the context of the command used.

image::EmailSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Example: Interview timeslot

This is for opening the email dialog for sending the email to the Interviewee of his/her allocated interview timeslot. Details that vary according to the Interviewee include:

* Date and time of allocated timeslot
* Interviewer allocated

Additional details that can be configured by the user (as user preferences) include:

* Location to report
* Dress code
* Any other additional information

The message content can also be configured by the user. However, a default template will be used when no such configuration file exists or is provided.

// end::email[]

=== Display
==== Implementation

The display feature allows user to toggle views of schedules, interviewer list and interviewee list. It uses an interface named TabListener and contains
the following method:

* `changeTabSchedule()` allows user to change to schedule view.
* `changeTabInterviewee()` allows user to change to interviewee list view.
* `changeTabInterviewer()` allows user to change to interviewer list view.

The activity diagram will provide the overall flow of this implementation.

image::DisplayActivity.png

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*
* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[Implementation-Configuration]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
